# Remnant-World-Analyzer

## Description

This project very similar to hzla's original world analyzer and Razzmatazzz's save manager. It is a tool that allows people to analyze remnant worlds. I made it because I had problems with those two options. The original world analyzer has ceased development and has a lot of bugs. On the other hand, the save manager is a downloadable executable rather than a website. This project attempts to provide a working world save analyzer that is more faithful to the original. However, it would not have been possible to do this without reading hzla's source code. Additionally, Razzmatazzz's save manager contains functionality that this website is unable to do such as identify a character's missing items and traits. Please check out both of those projects and support all of the people who contributed to them.
